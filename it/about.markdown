# Italian Version

Space After Borders invites young scholars (doctoral and post-doctoral phase) to reflect on and to participate in discussions on what it means to find oneself in a ‘space after borders’, that is, in between multiple languages, cultures, and identities. Where are the borders that define a culture, identity, or literary production? How can we look beyond them? How can we imagine a space after borders?

The summer school focuses on two phenomena in particular, arguing that a dialogue between these two will be fruitful to discuss these questions: 

1. (Italian) literatures of migration
2. translation studies. 

On the one hand, the theme of migration will be approached from a literary and philosophical perspective. In Migration Italy (2005), for example, Graziella Parati underlines that “the relevance that migrants’ literature has in shaping the future of Italian culture in a new multiculturalist direction that inscribes itself in the already multicultural Italian profile” (57). Parati furthermore notes that all speakers of Italian - be they born in or outside of Italy - differ with some degree from the national linguistic norm; hence, this creates a point of encounter “between two different embodiments of distance from a national language (that of the native Italian and that of the migrant)” (55-56). 

On the other hand, in translation studies, the need to relate Italian literature with ‘foreign’ literature which was translated in Italian, is increasingly felt; as is evident in Michele Sisto’s (2018) attempt to create what he calls a “storia italiana della letteratura mondiale” (an Italian history of world literature). Translation studies thus tend to turn towards questions of migration and its literature; while literatures and philosophies of migration interrogate unitary visions of national languages and identities. 

Combining these perspectives, Space After Borders will create a dialogue between various cultural and linguistic realities, including aspects related to notions of identity on collective and individual levels.
