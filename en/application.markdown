**Deadline extended**

Applications have to include the participant's curriculum and a motivation letter, which can be sent to: **spaziooltreiconfini.22@gmail.com**
until 15 April 2022. The selection criteria consist in the quality of the motivation letter and the academic profiles in the curriculum. The aim is to compose a mixed group of (post-)doctoral candidates, especially including members of underrepresented groups, deriving from various fields of study. 

The costs will consist of a fee of CHF 60,00 and the tourist tax of CHF 3,30. Travel expenses are to be paid by the participant.
