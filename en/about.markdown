In the current era of globalization, humans, languages, cultures, books, artefacts and products continuously travel, interact, and change. Consequently, the concept of ‘border’ understood as an unmovable entity or place is subject to change as well. Suggesting that this concept is ever less adequate to describe today’s realities, the summer school _Space After Borders. Migration, Literature and Translation_ aims to conceive of ways of imagining space after borders. It invites young scholars to reflect on and to participate in discussions on what it means to find oneself in a ‘space after borders’, that is, in between multiple languages, cultures, and identities. Where are the borders that define a culture, identity, or literary production? How can we look beyond them? How can we imagine a space after borders?

The summer school focuses on two phenomena in particular, arguing that a dialogue between these two will be fruitful to discuss these questions: 

1. (Italian) literatures of migration
2. translation studies. 

On the one hand, the theme of migration will be approached from a literary and philosophical perspective. In _Migration Italy_ (Toronto University Press, 2005), for example, Graziella Parati underlines that “the relevance that migrants’ literature has in shaping the future of Italian culture in a new multiculturalist direction that inscribes itself in the already multicultural Italian profile” (57). Parati furthermore notes that all speakers of Italian - be they born in or outside of Italy - differ with some degree from the national linguistic norm; hence, this creates a point of encounter “between two different embodiments of distance from a national language (that of the native Italian and that of the migrant)” (55-56). 

On the other hand, in translation studies, the need to relate Italian literature with ‘foreign’ literature which was translated in Italian, is increasingly felt; as is evident from Michele Sisto (_La letteratura tedesca in Italia_, Quodlibet, 2018) to create what he calls a “storia italiana della letteratura mondiale” (an Italian history of world literature). Translation studies thus tend to turn towards questions of migration and its literature, while literatures and philosophies of migration interrogate unitary visions of national languages and identities. 

Combining these perspectives, the Summer School _Space After Borders_ will create a dialogue between scholars of multiple generations from various cultural and linguistic realities, on topics including notions of identity on collective and individual levels.

The summer school will be largely held in Italian, and at least a passive knowledge of the Italian language is highly recommended. Yet, it will also be open to interested doctoral and postdoctoral candidates of other languages and literatures.
